Theory:
Multilevel inheritance in Java occurs when a class is derived from a class that is 
already derived from another class. This forms a chain of inheritance.  

In this program:  
- The `Vehicle` class is the parent class with a method `showSpeed()`.  
- The `Car` class extends `Vehicle` and overrides `showSpeed()`, while still 
  calling the parent method using `super`.  
- The `SportsCar` class extends `Car` and further overrides `showSpeed()`.  
- This demonstrates how each subclass can build upon the functionality of its parent class.

// Parent class
class Vehicle {
    void showSpeed() {
        System.out.println("Speed of Vehicle is: 67 km/h");
    }    
}

// Child class (inherits Vehicle)
class Car extends Vehicle {
    @Override
    void showSpeed() {
        super.showSpeed(); // Call Vehicle's method
        System.out.println("Speed of Car is: 200 km/h");
    }
}

// Grandchild class (inherits Car)
class SportsCar extends Car {
    @Override
    void showSpeed() {
        super.showSpeed(); // Call Car's method
        System.out.println("Speed of Sports Car is: 300 km/h");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Exp7b {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SportsCar sc = new SportsCar(); // Create SportsCar object
        sc.showSpeed(); // Call method to display speeds
    }
}
