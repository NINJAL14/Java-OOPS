Theory: Pattern programming is a fundamental concept in programming that helps develop logical thinking and understanding of nested loops. These programs demonstrate three different pattern types: sequential number pattern, star-number pattern with modulus operation, and arithmetic progression pattern. Nested loops are used where the outer loop controls rows and inner loop controls columns/elements in each row. The modulus operator (%) is used to create alternating patterns, input validation ensures proper range checking, and counter variables help track and display sequential numbers. Java's nested for loops, conditional statements (if-else), and arithmetic operations are effectively utilized to create visually appealing patterns that enhance programming logic and mathematical understanding.
