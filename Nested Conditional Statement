Theory: Conditional statements are fundamental control structures in programming that allow programs to make decisions based on different conditions. This program demonstrates nested if-else statements and logical operators to classify numbers as "Weird" or "Not Weird" based on specific rules. The modulus operator (%) is used to determine if a number is odd or even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. The classification logic follows these rules: all odd numbers are "Weird", even numbers between 2-5 are "Not Weird", even numbers between 6-20 are "Weird", and even numbers greater than 20 are "Not Weird". Nested conditional statements allow for complex decision-making processes where multiple conditions are evaluated in a hierarchical manner. The Scanner class enables interactive input from users, and proper input buffer clearing using nextLine() prevents input-related issues in console applications.
