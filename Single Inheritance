Theory:
Inheritance is an important feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that 
allows a class (child/subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of 
another class (parent/superclass). This promotes reusability and extensibility.  

In this program: 
- The `Employee` class is the parent class containing employee details and a 
  method to calculate yearly salary.  
- The `Manager` class extends `Employee` (child class) and inherits all its 
  members while adding its own property (department) and methods.  
- Method overriding is used in `Manager` to customize the display of details.
