Theory: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software programs. This program demonstrates key OOP concepts including encapsulation (data hiding using private variables), abstraction (through public methods), and method implementation for real-world banking operations. The Bank_account class encapsulates account details like balance and account number, while providing public methods for accessing and modifying these attributes safely. Banking operations include deposit (adding money), withdrawal (with balance validation), and balance inquiry. Getter and setter methods follow Java naming conventions and provide controlled access to private class variables. The 'this' keyword is used to distinguish between instance variables and method parameters, ensuring proper data manipulation and maintaining object state integrity.
